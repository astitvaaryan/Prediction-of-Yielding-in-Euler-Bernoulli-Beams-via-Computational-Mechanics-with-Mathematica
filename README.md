### 1. **Introduction**
   - This project aims to predict the yielding behavior in Euler-Bernoulli beams under various loading conditions using a computational model developed in Wolfram Mathematica.

### 2. **Project Description**
   - The project involves simulating the deformation of Euler-Bernoulli beams, analyzing stress distribution, and identifying critical points of yielding. The model integrates principles of solid mechanics with computational methods for enhanced structural analysis accuracy.

### 3. **Requirements**
  - Wolfram Mathematica
  - Basic understanding of solid mechanics and beam theory

### 4. **Project Structure**
  - `Code_file.nb`: Contains the Mathematica code for simulating beam deformation and predicting yielding.
  - `MOS_Report.pdf`: Detailed report on the project's methodology, results, and conclusions.

### 5. **How to Use**
   1. Open `Code_file.nb` in Wolfram Mathematica.
   2. Run the cells sequentially to simulate the deformation and analyze the results.
   3. Modify the input parameters (e.g., load, beam properties) as needed to explore different scenarios.

### 6. **Methodology**
   - The project uses numerical methods to simulate beam deformation based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The stress distribution is analyzed to predict the onset of yielding.

### 7. **Results**
  - **Stress Distribution**: The stress distribution along the Euler-Bernoulli beam was accurately predicted, showing maximum stress at the midspan under uniform load, consistent with theoretical expectations.
  
  - **Yielding Predictions**: Applying Von Mises and Tresca criteria revealed that yielding occurs where stress exceeds material strength. The Von Mises criterion predicted yielding in regions of combined stress, while the Tresca criterion, being more conservative, highlighted yielding where maximum shear stress reaches the shear yield strength.

### 8. **Conclusion**
  - This project demonstrates the utility of computational methods in predicting structural behavior, offering valuable tools for engineers and researchers.
